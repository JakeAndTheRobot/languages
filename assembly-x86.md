# x86 assembly

x86 assembly is a low-level programming language that can be used to directly control the hardware of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It is called "x86" because the instructions it uses are specific to CPUs that use the x86 architecture, which includes most modern CPUs. Assembly language is typically used to write programs that have a high degree of control over the hardware, such as operating systems and device drivers. It is also used for performance-critical applications, such as video games, where the extra control and optimization provided by assembly language can make a significant difference in the speed and efficiency of the program.

Here is a list of some common x86 assembly instructions:

| Command	| Description
|---------|------------
| mov: | moves a value from one location to another
| add: | adds two values and stores the result
| sub: | subtracts one value from another and stores the result
| mul: | multiplies two values and stores the result
| div: | divides one value by another and stores the result
| inc: | increments a value by 1
| dec: | decrements a value by 1
| push: | pushes a value onto the stack
| pop: | pops a value off the stack
| jmp: | jumps to a specified location in the program
| je: | jumps to a specified location if two values are equal
| jne: | jumps to a specified location if two values are not equal
| jg: | jumps to a specified location if one value is greater than another
| jl: | jumps to a specified location if one value is less than another
