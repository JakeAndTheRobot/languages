# Scratch

1. To create a new project in Scratch, click on the "Create" button in the top right corner of the Scratch website.
2. To add a new sprite (i.e., a character or object) to your project, click on the "Choose a Sprite" button in the top left corner of the Scratch editor. You can choose from a variety of pre-made sprites or upload your own image.
3. To add a new block of code to your project, drag and drop blocks from the blocks palette on the right side of the Scratch editor into the scripts area on the left.
4. To run your code, click on the green "Go" button in the top right corner of the Scratch editor.
5. To add loops to your code, you can use the "forever" block or the "repeat" block. The "forever" block will run the blocks inside it continuously, while the "repeat" block will run the blocks inside it a specified number of times.
6. To add conditions to your code, you can use the "if" block. The blocks inside the "if" block will only run if the condition specified is true.
7. To add comments to your code, you can use the "Comment" block. Comments are notes that you can add to your code to explain what it does. They will not be run as code and are only there to help you and others understand the code.
